# Pagy Contributions

Pull Requests are welcome!

Setting up a development environment for Pagy is very simple if you use the [Pagy Docker Environment](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/tree/master/docker).

Before spending time creating a (potentially complex) Pull Request, you can [Confirm on Gitter](https://gitter.im/ruby-pagy/Lobby) whether your proposed changes are going to be useful for most users.

If you Create A Pull Request, please ensure that the "All checks have passed" indicator gets green light on the Pull Request page. That means that the tests passed and Codecov and Rubocop are happy.

Thank you!
