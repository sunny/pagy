# TypeScript source

This is the source dir that generates the the files in the `lib/javascripts` dir. 

- The `pagy-dev.js` is just transpiled by `tsc` from TypeScript and includes the source map of the original `pagy-dev.ts`. It is meant to be used only for debugging on modern browsers.  
- The `pagy.js` is generated by `parcel` for production. It is polyfilled for the `{"browserlist": [">0.25%", "not dead"}` and minified. 

You can generate custom targeted javascript files for the browsers you need by changing the `browserlist` query in
`src/package.json`, then compile it with `npm run build -w src`.
