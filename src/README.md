# TypeScript source

This is the source dir that generates the the files in the `lib/javascripts` dir. 

- The `pagy.mjs` is a ES6 module that exports the static `Pagy` object by default, only meant to be imported in other modules.
- The `pagy-dev.js` is a readable javascript file meant to be used only for debugging with modern browsers.
- The `pagy.js` is generated by `parcel` for production. It is polyfilled for the `{"browserlist": [">0.25%", "not dead"}` and minified and meant to be loaded in your production pages.

You can generate custom targeted `pagy.js` files for the browsers you need by changing the `browserlist` query in
`src/package.json`, then compile it with `npm run build -w src`.
